# Login Webapp

A small project to create a `login` page, a `home` page and a `register` page with some validation features on user input, password and his authorities. Inside `pom.xml`
you will find these dependencies:
 
 - *Spring Web*
 - *Spring JPA* 
 - *Spring Security*
 - *Apache Freemarker* 
 - *MySql Connector*

Implemented using  **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **Javascript**, **JQuery**, **Java** and **MySQL**.

## How to use?

To simply login you can either enter the default email and password stored in DB located at `import.sql` *or
you can actually make your own account* by clicking at the link under login prompt when in `/login`!

> **Note:** The Webapp doesn't actually use any form of encryption besides plain text because it checks for a specific **regular expression** that BCrypt may violate. So for simplification I don't use it.
